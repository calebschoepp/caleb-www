My team and I won [HackED 2022](https://hacked-2022.devpost.com/) by building StudyBuddy -- an application that uses generative AI to make practice quizzes from your notes. We built it with **Rails** and **GPT-3**. You can read more about it [here](/blog/2022/building-studybuddy-at-hacked-2022).

Finding internships is difficult. Some friends and I set out to help by building a platform to facilitate resume reviews and mock interviews.
We called it CompE+. It was built with **TypeScript** and **React**.

At [HackED 2021](https://hacked-2021.devpost.com/) I set out with a team to make learning
**JavaScript** syntax easier. We made a VS Code extension called [GrokJS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=grokjs.grok-js)
that helps users by directly annotating the source code with descriptions of the syntax and links to documentation. We finished in the top
6 and got to present our project at [DemoCamp](https://youtu.be/zyFWEHhFllQ?t=879). You can read more about it [here](/blog/2021/building-grokjs-at-hacked-2021).

{{% img_row_right src="/spotify_queue_shuffler.png" alt="Spotify Queue Shuffler Logo" %}}
Spotify has shuffle functionality, but it only works for playlists and
albums. [qShuffle.com](https://qshuffle.com)
allows you to shuffle the songs lined up in your queue. I wrote it in
**React** and used the Spotify Web **API**. I also made it a [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) so that it can be installed to users devices.{{% /img_row_right %}}

{{% img_row_left src="/mixtape_manager.png" alt="MixtapeManager Logo" %}}
Building Spotify playlists by hand can be tedious so I set out to
make it easier. [MixtapeManager](https://mixtapemanager.ca) let's you schedule the automatic
building of playlists. Some of the technologies I built this with are **Go**, **PostgreSQL**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind.css**.

{{% img_row_right src="/nqq_icon.png" alt="NQQ Logo" %}}
During the Spring of 2020 I read [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) which guides you through using **C** to implement an interpreted language called Lox. Afterwards I continued to improve my implementation that I called [NQQ](https://github.com/calebschoepp/nqq). Notably, I added list and map
data structures to the language and wrote a [blog post](https://calebschoepp.com/blog/2020/adding-a-list-data-type-to-lox/) about the process.
