Hi I'm Caleb, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Alberta. Currently, I'm working on the Azure Data Usage Billing team at Microsoft. In the fall I will be going to work with [Resemble AI](https://resemble.ai) to help build state of the art synthetic voices. Over the past year I was working on biometric authentication at [UnifyID](https://unify.id).
