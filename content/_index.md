Hi, I'm Caleb. I'm a software engineer at Fermyon helping to build the future of server side web assembly. I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta. In the past I've interned at UnifyID, Resemble AI, and Microsoft three times. I like building full-stack apps, playing guitar, and spending time with my family. Please get in touch, I'd love to chat.
