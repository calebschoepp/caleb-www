Hi, I'm Caleb. I'm a software engineer at Fermyon helping to build the future of serverless WebAssembly. I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta. In the past I've interned at UnifyID, Resemble AI, and Microsoft. I like building systems software, training for triathlons, writing music, and spending time with my family. Please get in touch, I'd love to chat.
