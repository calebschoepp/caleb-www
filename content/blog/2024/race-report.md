On March 25, 2024 I signed up to compete in the [Great White North Sprint Triathlon](https://platinumracing.ca/great-white-north/). This decision was preceded by months of me mulling over competing in my first ever triathlon. Race day (July 7) has come and gone and I'm so glad I decided to participate. Here is my race report.

## Training

I had just about three and half months to train for my first ever triathlon. This was adequate, but I wouldn't have wanted any less time to train given my relative inexperience. The biggest takeaway from my training was that I should have used a formal plan. I always intended to choose and follow a plan, but every time I looked I was intimated by how complex they were. Instead I just winged it. This was a big mistake.

I was most nervous for the swim because I was the least experienced and confident at swimming — especially in open water. I ended up doing 10 swims total each slowly building up endurance. In terms of distance I swam about 10 km. Only one of my training sessions was in open water and none of them were with my wetsuit (in fact I barely managed to procure a wetsuit in time for the race). I should have trained my swim more... in open water... with more sophistication[^1]. A couple lessons on form also would have gone a long way.

I was not at all concerned about the biking portion of the race. The only reason I trained here was because I enjoy biking and because I knew this was where I would make up the most time on the race day. I ended up doing 14 rides for a total distance of 307 km. If that seems like way more distance than it should be that is because I snuck a metric century in there for fun. My biggest mistakes here were not spending enough time in aero position to get used to it and not doing enough intervals/tempo work[^2].

If I was nervous for the swim then I was apprehensive for the run. For many years I've avoided running due to bad knees, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that my knees were a non-issue in my training and on race day. Despite having no training plan I did my best to slowly add running load so I wouldn't trigger any injuries. My first runs were very slow and trepidatious 2k's. Overall I did 25 runs for a total distance of 118 km. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I quite like running — so long as I run with someone or have a podcast pumped into my ears. Again my approach was very brain dead. No sprints/tempo/interval work, very little science in the load or pace, etc.

Despite my many missteps I was pleased with the brick training I did. Throughout my training I did 7 brick training sessions. These ended up being really helpful. In one of the bricks I did all three in a try-a-tri distance which gave me a lot of confidence. The big takeaways for next time are:

- Follow a training plan.
- Train more.
- Focus more on the swim and less on the bike and run.
- Train more in open water.

## Race Day

The race day was a beautiful, warm, sunny, and windy day. Since T1 and T2 were at different locations I had already racked my bike the previous day[^3]. The sprint distance was the last heat to go so I anxiously waited around in the morning watching other racers. I was very anxious about not having enough time to put on my wetsuit. So in a rookie move I put it on way too early and baked in the sun. Right before the heat they allowed us to splash around in the water to acclimatize. That was helpful and prevented me from dealing with any cold shock (in addition to the wetsuit and the water only being 18 degrees celsius).

### Swim

After a quick countdown my first ever triathlon was underway. I had purposely seeded myself to the back of the pack and so getting into the water was very anti-climactic. It was my intention to swim at a slow pace, but in the excitement I started my swim off much too fast. I quickly passed a few people which put me in the thick of things. About 200m in another swimmer started bumping into my leg over and over again so I dipped out of the way. But, the combination of going to fast and this dodging maneuver made me lose my breathing pattern. Suddenly I couldn't do the front crawl I had practiced. Rather, I was swimming with my head out of the water. I was aware enough to realize that I was starting to panic, but I wasn't able to calm myself down.

In my panicked state I just switched to a mix of back crawl and head up front crawl for the rest of the swim. Unfortunately, I zig-zagged terribly on my back and I found sighting incredibly difficult because I had never practiced. It didn't help that my swim cap was coming off my head pulling my goggles off my eyes. Honestly, I was pretty terrified out there. Had the swim been much longer I think there is a reasonable chance I would have given up. Wearing a wetsuit was a godsend because of the extra flotation.

When I finally made it to the shore I dragged myself out of the water. I almost kissed the ground. For the most part T1 went well. The one hiccup was that I couldn't get the hair tie out of my hair and my bun was too high to fit under my helmet. I ended up just pushing the bun down the back of my head and doing the rest of the race with my hair in this messy state.

There was lots to improve about my swim — primarily swimming slower. But, I'm pleased that the abysmal start didn't wreck the rest of my race.

- Was worried about the cold shock but the water was 18c and the warm up swim made that fine.
- Seeded myself at the back of the pack, but in hindsight started out much to fast (I passed a couple people).
- Quickly got tired and then was battling with a guy which put me into panic mode.
- Spent 80% of the swim alternating between back crawl and head up front crawl.
- Never was able to come breathing, even though I made a conscious effort to do so once.
- Struggled to swim straight, struggled to sight, struggled to feel calm.
- The whole time the shore felt far away and that was terrifying.
- Came out of the water haggard and did a slow transition and struggled with my hair.
- Had it gone any worse I may have tapped out.
- The wetsuit was a god send.
- I should have just gone much slower. Thankfully I didn't let this abysmal start wreck the rest of my race

### Bike

- Mantra was high cadence and aero position.
- Went by really quick.
- Couple hills but mostly downhill.
- Bit of a headwind.
- Aero position really helped.
- Passed about six people, passed by about two.
- Mostly alone on the ride.
- Bit of right hamstring tightness, but otherwise felt good.
- It was hard to know if I was pushing too much.
- Confusing flat tire situation.
- Sugar water concoction sucked. Just wanted nice water.

### Run

![Run course map](/gwn-run.png)

- Quick transition, but almost forgot my number.
- Felt limited by cardio, not my legs, so my brick workouts must have paid off.
- The turnaround point felt so far away.
- Lots of encouragement for people
- Last 1.25km I started to feel shivers from the heat. Definitely hadn't drank enough water.
- Crossing the finish line for the first time ever felt great.
- Felt like I was most in the pain box in the run.

## Post Race

- Totally zonked.
- Didn't stretch.
- Proabably did a terrible job refueling and rehydrating.

## Results

- Numbers and tables.
- Expectations.
- Link to actual data.

## Another One?

- Immediatley after I was like "never again".
- For sure half marathon in the fall.
- Maybe an olympic triathlon next year.

[^1]: A standard swim session for me looked like spending the first 15 minutes trying to get my swim cap on, swimming 750m at a medium pace, and then chilling in the steam room.
[^2]: Read as zero.
[^3]: Which included me wading through all the confusion that is setting up your transition zones for the first time as a new triathlete.
