- Beautiful day
- Showed up early
- Saw some friends were running the race
- Olympian ran us out
- Much more packed than a triathlon
- Started fast but not insanely fast
- My watch was reading slower than Jon's phone
- After about 3km Jon split off from me
- I drafted off grace and caleb until about 10km
- Then I split off and accidentally sped up
- Then I hit a wall at 16 km
- Messed up grabbing the water
- Nutrition was good throughout
- All I wanted to do was stop when the wall hit
- Both cardio and leg limited
- Foot held on throughout
- Really just a mental game
- Past some people at the end
- Basically limped through to the finish line
- Could hardly stand up
- Even with lots of stretching and ice bath I could hardly walk for 2 days after
- Heart was in zone 5 80% of the time up at 170 to 180
- Muscles were soooo tense at the end
- It was such a long run through the arena.
