I have a pornography problem and and I don't know what to do about it.

It is well understood that social media[^1] can have a negative impact on your life. It can cause:

- **Feelings of jealousy, anxiousness, and loneliness** induced by only seeing the heavily curated feeds of those who you follow. Ultimately, leading to unrealistic expectations about what your life should be like mixed with a constant bombardment of FOMO.
- **An increasingly polarized, misinformed, and enraged outlook on life** as the incentives of our digital world push you deeper into a filter bubble. In the extreme case even leading to the radicalization of individuals.
- **A crippling loss of time and agency** caused by the addictive and distracting tendencies of these platforms. The push notification acting as a phantasmal chain tethering us to our phone. Watching content not because you truly want to but just -- because?

But, what I've recently come to realize is that there is an even more pernicious way in which social media is negatively impacting my life. Social media is becoming productivity porn for me.

Content that is acting as PP is stuff that makes you feel like you've been productive when in reality all you've done is watch someone else do something. Things like podcasts or blog posts about how to do anything.

I discovered this type of damaging by having numerous wake up calls in a row from blogs or books that made this meta point. In fact they were productivity pornography themselves but were at least meta enough to point it out.

This type of harm scares me so much because I don't know how to counteract it. With wasting my time I know that I will eventually get tired of this and will want to do something productive. With jealousy I know to just avoid it entirely. However, with PP it is empty calories that are just so much easier then creating and doing something yourself. Moreover, the helpful aspects are actually that. Helpful. I don't know what to do
