This past weekend I participated in [HackED 2022](https://hacked-2022.devpost.com/), the annual hackathon put on by the U of A Computer Engineering club. My teammates Armi, Cyrus, Ryan, and I built a web app called StudyBuddy and we finished in first place winning a $1000 grand prize. I wanted to reflect on the experience like I did [last year]({{< ref "/blog/building_grokjs_at_hacked_2021.md" >}}).

- Planned the idea in advance was helpful
- Idea from Zohaib
- Who was my team
- Implementation
- Worked until 6:30 am then slept a bit
- Demos suck
- Should have gone to sleep earlier
- Really like rails. Let us make a super polished
