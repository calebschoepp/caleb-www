A little more than a year ago I started [teaching myself](/blog/2022/skating-my-way-to-a-new-mindset) to skate at the outdoor rink near my house. Five months ago I enrolled in a beginner hockey program for adults called [Discover Hockey](https://www.discoverhockey.com/). Two months ago I started playing on my first proper beer league hockey team. Going from not knowing how to skate to playing on a team once a week has been quite the transition and I wanted to document what learning to play hockey as an adult has been like.

Perhaps the predominant emotion I've felt throughout this process has been excitement. I'm not exaggerating when I say that for the first few months my hockey night was the best night of my week. The rest of the week I would be day dreaming about getting back on the ice. Driving to the rink I would feel a giddiness that I hadn't felt in years. While there has been a natural tempering of this passion, game night is still the best part of my week. Hockey is a thrilling game to watch and an even more thrilling game to play.
