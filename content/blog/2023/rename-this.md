A topic that is always on my mind is how I can be more effective at what I am doing. As I prepare to start a new full-time job soon in particular I've been focused on my efficacy at work. Through lots of reflection I've determined that one of my bigger weaknesses is a desire to do something perfectly the first time. I harbor a sense of perfection.

This manifests itself in many ways, but is perhaps best demonstrated by when I'm working on building a new feature. Up front it is impossible to know how to correctly build the feature. My reaction to this is to spend a long time sitting and thinking about the right way to do it. This is the wrong reaction. A better path forward would be to iterate and experiment. Write code that I'm willing to throw away for the purpose of learning more about the problem.

It's like I'm trying to find a room in a giant building. My default reaction is like flying around the building in a helicopter trying to see if I can see the room through a window. This is ridiculous. I don't even know what the room looks like. The correct thing to do would be to go in to the building and start looking for the room. In fact there is probably even signage in the building that would help me find my way.

My advice to you is that you should avoid harboring a sense of perfection. Don't be afraid of getting dirty and iterating because that is the faster way to do things.

But wait, that advice is quite brittle. What if speed of iteration isn't important in your role like it is in software engineering. Maybe you're a school teacher and it is more important that you take special care with everything you do because it can really affect the kids. Let me try again but this time phrase it via a question.

If you desire to be effective at what you do it is important to understand where you struggle. Ask yourself the questions: what are my failure modes? A failure mode is a place where you keep tripping up and holding yourself back. If you can identify these failure modes then you can start fixing them. And if you can fix them you can become more effective.
