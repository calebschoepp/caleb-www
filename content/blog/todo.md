I was recently at inception and I wanted to write down everything I learned.

### I should take as much risk as possible

Ian and Greg. Worst case scenario is not bad at all.

### I should see a therapist or lifecoach regularly

You spend all day in your brain as a programmer and mental health is incredibly important.

### Engineering management and the moral imperative to have the difficult conversation

Because if you don't have it you're going to end up firing them in a year and a half which is awful and you could have just had the conversation.

### Andy Chou on entrepreneurship - Stay at small companies and take action and talk to customers

Action is more important then whether you start with an idea or start with finding a problem to work on. Find what resonates with you and gets you excited.

### LLM mental models

Axe head, fine tuning, importance of prompts

### Needs for tooling in the LLM space

So hard to work on prompt engineering

### Future of LLMs

GPT-4 will be huge, will it be too expensive? Is building LLM's from scratch necessary or are we just not writing the right prompts. What will the next architecture be and will it involve some sort of semantic linking between inputs. I think LLM's are turning into commodities.

### Digital nomad hacker house

I want to learn more about this.

### I want to do more hackathons

I want to do more of this and meet a lot more smart motivated people.

### Threefold training mental health

Talking with Ian

### Respect the LLMs

They are smarter than we give them credit for.

### The importance of ego and humbleness

Stay low ego

Andy Chou thought I was a sr. engineer
Aaron was very impressed with my skills as an undergraduate.
