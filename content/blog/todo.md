**TODO fix title**

**TODO fix publish date**

**TODO fix filename**

**TODO is this actually pattern matching moreso than transfer learning**

Onboarding into a new software engineering role is difficult. There is a lot to learn before you can get up to speed. The business domain, system architecture, team workflow, version control patterns, meeting culture, and probably even some new programming languages. It can feel like you are drinking from a firehose. Recently, I've found a strategy that helps me manage this.

I like to call it transfer learning, alluding to the [machine learning technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) with the same name. The general idea is that knowledge gained in one domain can help you succeed in another domain. As an example from the world of machine learning, you might use a model trained on a general image dataset to give you a head start on training a model for an image dataset specifically of leopards. But, how does this apply to onboarding?

Turns out you can do something similar with your knowledge.
