Rock climbing is a great mental model for using version control software like Git. I hope that by the end of this post: you'll have a better sense of how to get the most out of Git and your hands will be a little sweaty at the thought of all this rock climbing.

The goal of rock climbing is to make it to the top of the wall or to traverse a particularly challenging route. Obviously, falling off the wall is both going to prevent you from accomplishing the goal and put you in danger of hurting yourself.

Programming is a lot like this too. You are trying to solve a problem with software and doing so requires solving a complex set of interlocking logic puzzles. Everytime you try to add a new feature or fix a bug there is a chance that your new code won't work. If this keeps happening your codebase will get messy and confusing and you might fail to solve the problem.

![Bouldering](/bouldering.jpg)

Bouldering is a type of rock climbing performed on small rock formations without the protection of ropes. Because there are no ropes to catch your fall, you don't climb very high when you are bouldering.

This is just like small exploratory coding sessions. I'm talking about that little Python script to do a bit of math. Or that tiny little Rust program to see how that one library works. The kind of work that you aren't really intending to keep around.

If you mess up your little test script it isn't a big deal because your not losing that much work. Similar to how if you fall when you're bouldering you're probably not gonna die.

Bouldering is tantamount to coding without version control. Perhaps the only protection you have is a small crashpad. The equivalent of copy pasting commenting and editing.

Destination, routes, failure & falling

Bouldering is really simple. No ropes and crash pads

If you're crazy you go free soloing. Bad idea

So we rope in (lots of types but ignore most). Lead climbing is like using git. Here is the crux of the metaphor. It is all about understanding how fall you can far and the risks.

Rock climbing draws a lot of parallels

Rock climbing makes for a beautiful metaphor for using Git version control. Ideally, you are using Git in a fashion similar to lead climbing. Let me explain more. Image of rock climbing types This is a dichotomy of the types of rock climbing. You can see that it makes a sort of tree where each type has numerous subtypes that vary in some way. Image of aid climbing Aid climbing is where you use implements

Aid climbing is where you use implements to help you pull yourself up the wall. This is sort of like using a tutorial to implement a solution. You're probably having fun and learning something along the way -- but you didn't actually do it yourself. This doesn't have much to do with Git. The other large class of climbing is free climbing. This is where you're actually doing the work and climbing up the rock yourself. Drawing the parallel to code, this is where you are actually solving a problem with code using your own skills. When you go free climbing if you aren't tied in anywhere then you are considered unroped. If your sticking to reasonable heights then you're bouldering. This is similar to making some scratch scripts to test something out when coding. I'm talking about that little Python script to do a bit of math. Or that tiny little Rust program to see how that one library works. The kind of work that you aren't really intending to keep around. Since it isn't forever code you aren't worried about git (ropes). Often you'll use a crash pad when you are bouldering to soften your fall if you lose your grip. Falling while coding is like trying out something that just doesn't work and needing to go back. Without ropes you have no easy way to go back to where you were. The crashpad of coding is copying your work, commenting the orignal, and modifying the copy. Not great but it saves you in the short term. If you're a more ~~mentally unstable~~ adventurous climber you might free solo. This is where you go climb whatever the hell you feel like unroped -- and potentially pay the cost. My advice is to not do this type of climbing or coding. You are asking for trouble going very far into a project without version control. So I've convinced you that it might be a good idea to rope in? ddddddddddddddddd ESTABLISH PARALLELS OF FALLING AND ROPES EARLY ON.
