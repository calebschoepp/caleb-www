Let's play a game, below are some snippets in JavaScript and Python that use some complicated syntax. Try to figure out what they're doing.

```js
let a = 1;
// TODO
```

```js
let a = 1;
// TODO
```

*Answers to JavaScript questions.*[^1][^2]

```python
a = 1
# TODO
```

```python
a = 1
# TODO
```

*Answers to Python questions.*[^3][^4]

How did you fare? Was it harder than you thought it would be? Did you struggle with this code even if you knew the language well? I certainly didn't know what this code did before making these questions.

Anecdote/experience of hitting confusing syntax during programming?

I believe that understanding complex programming language syntax is still an unsolved problem. In this blog post I intend to explain the problem, show its relevance, and propose some solutions.



## Points I'm trying to get across
* Syntax is hard, even not as a beginner
* The world is a multi language world
* Googling for help with syntax is nigh impossible
* Semantics vs syntax
* This can be solved with IDE tooling
* Annotate the code with the abstract syntax tree
* Implementation details
* Some sort of LSP protocol?
* This sort of tool isn't best for beginners
