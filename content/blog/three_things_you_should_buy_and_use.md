Inspired by Dynomight's list of [creative nonfiction training exercises](https://dynomight.net/training/) here is a list of three things that you should buy and use.

# Password Manager

It took me way too long to get on this train, but using a password manager has removed so many problems from my digital life like:

- Trying to think of a new password when creating an account
- Trying to remember which variation of my password I used on a given site (did it begin with a capital or end with a 1?)
- Still being incredibly insecure because I'm constantly reusing the same password

I can't recommend a password manager strongly enough. The benefit is clear: you'll reduce your cognitive overhead to a single password and greatly increase your security at the same time.

The thing about password managers is that it doesn't really matter which one you use. Using a password manager is so much better than not using one that the minute differences between each are almost irrelevant. That being said, I use [1Password](https://1password.com/) and recommend you do too. I started out using [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) but found the user interface unsatisfactory. 1Password is really pleasant to use and is reasonably priced.

You need to keep two things in mind to have the most success with password managers. First, you need to pay for it. Your password manager is going to be the foundation of your digital security --- don't leave that up to a free plan. Second, commit to it 100%. That means you need to put every password into it[^1] and you need to change every password to a securely generated and unique password. If you'll keep these two things in mind you'll have a great time.

[^1]: Yes, even your most cherished passwords like your Google or Facebook accounts. For that matter, I recommend you put **everything** in your password manager. I keep my credit cards and important documents in my password manager too.
