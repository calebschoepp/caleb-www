I have a pornography problem and if you're anything like me you might too.

It is well understood that social media[^1] can have a negative impact on your life. Whether you are doom-scrolling on Instagram, furiously retweeting on Twitter, or on your fifth hour of Youtube, you might experience:

- **Feelings of jealousy, anxiousness, and loneliness** induced by only seeing the heavily curated feeds of those who you follow. Ultimately, leading to unrealistic expectations about what your life should be like mixed with a constant bombardment of FOMO.
- **An increasingly polarized, misinformed, and enraged outlook on life** as the incentives of our digital world push you deeper into a filter bubble. In the extreme case even leading to the radicalization of individuals.
- **A crippling loss of time and agency** caused by the addictive and distracting tendencies of these platforms. The push notification acting as a phantasmal chain tethering us to our phone. Watching content not because you truly want to but just --- because?

But, what I've recently come to realize is that there is an even more pernicious way in which social media is negatively impacting my life. Social media is becoming productivity porn for me.

Productivity porn is anything that after having been consumed makes you feel like you were productive when in reality you didn't actually do anything. Just like regular pornography it stimulates you without even performing the act. It is a hollow imitation of the real thing.

Examples of productivity porn include but are not limited to: reading a tweet by a top VC about how to become a better startup founder; watching a Youtube video about the 7 mistakes you need to avoid at the gym; perusing a Hacker News thread about how to improve the code you write. All of these activities deceptively make you feel like you've done something productive. "I just learned something new", you tell yourself. But even so you continue the viscious cycle of not actually doing what you set out to do but instead just thinking about doing it.

Keep in mind that productivity can mean a variety of things. Founding a startup, working out at the gym, building a side project, reading a book, planting a garden. Regardless, the key is that you benefit from doing the actual activity, but not from thinking about doing it. Hence the problem with productivity pornography.

HOW I REALIZED THIS WAS A PROBLEM

WHY I FIND THIS UNIQUELY DANGEROUS.

- IT SAPS MY INTRISINC MOTIVATION

- IT IS DECEPTIVE, VERY EASY TO SEEM LIKE YOUR BEING PRODUCTIVE AND THEN REALIZE YOURE NOT ACTUALLY BEING PRODUCTIVE

- AT THE SAME TIME IT IS STILL HELPFUL IN MODERATION

- I CAN'T RUN AWAY TO BOOKS AND PODCASTS, JUST AS PROBLEMATIC. Social media is just a supercharged version of it

HOW TO CLOSE?

Content that is acting as PP is stuff that makes you feel like you've been productive when in reality all you've done is watch someone else do something. Things like podcasts or blog posts about how to do anything.

I discovered this type of damaging by having numerous wake up calls in a row from blogs or books that made this meta point. In fact they were productivity pornography themselves but were at least meta enough to point it out.

This type of harm scares me so much because I don't know how to counteract it. With wasting my time I know that I will eventually get tired of this and will want to do something productive. With jealousy I know to just avoid it entirely. However, with PP it is empty calories that are just so much easier then creating and doing something yourself. Moreover, the helpful aspects are actually that. Helpful. I don't know what to do
