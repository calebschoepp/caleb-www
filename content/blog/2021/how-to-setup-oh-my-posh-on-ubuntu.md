While onboarding at my latest internship I noticed that my manager had a very aesthetically pleasing shell. Upon further inspection I discovered he was using something called [Oh my Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/). It markets itself as, "A prompt theme engine for any shell." It's more than pretty though â€” it will also show you Git status, error codes, Python versions, and can be configured to do [more](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/config-segment).

I ended up installing it on both my Windows machine for work and my personal Ubuntu machine. However, I found the process more difficult on Ubuntu so I'm writing down the steps here.

Note that your machine might be a bit different than mine. Read the steps carefully as you may need to deviate from them. I'm running Ubuntu 20.04 with the Gnome desktop environment and I use Bash as my shell.

## Install Oh my Posh

The [docs](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/linux#installation) are fairly clear here so I recommend you follow along with them as they will be kept up to date. As of writing this post you need to run the following:

```bash
## Install Oh my Posh
sudo wget https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/posh-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh

## Download the themes
mkdir ~/.poshthemes
wget https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/themes.zip -O ~/.poshthemes/themes.zip
unzip ~/.poshthemes/themes.zip -d ~/.poshthemes
chmod u+rw ~/.poshthemes/*.json
rm ~/.poshthemes/themes.zip
```

## Change your prompt

This is also pretty straightforward in the [docs](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/linux#replace-your-existing-prompt). Add the following to you `~/.bashrc` and then source it. Replace `{theme}` below with your preferred theme. I like the Paradox theme.

```bash
eval "$(oh-my-posh --init --shell bash --config ~/.{theme}.omp.json)"
```

## Setup the fonts

This is the tricky part. Start by installing a nerd font from [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). I recommend using [Meslo](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/Meslo.zip). Now you need to install the font to your system. Based on the instructions found [here](https://gist.github.com/matthewjberger/7dd7e079f282f8138a9dc3b045ebefa0) we should do the following:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir .fonts
unzip ~/Downloads/Meslo.zip -d ~/.fonts/Meslo
fc-cache -fv
```

With the nerd font installed on the system we need to get Gnome Terminal to use it now. The gif below shows how to setup a new default profile using the font we installed.

After all that, you should be in business. Happy coding and I hope you find the theme as beautiful as I do.
