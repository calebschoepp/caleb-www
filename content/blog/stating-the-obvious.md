A common excuse people use for not writing is that they don't have anything insightful to say. They don't want to state the obvious. I think this is a terrible excuse and that more people should write about obvious things.

Setting aside the likelihood that you do have insightful things to share, here are three reasons why stating the obvious is a good idea.

First, obviousness is a relative concept, not absolute. This means that what is obvious to you is not necessarily obvious to others. The clearest example of this is your past self. For example, it is currently obvious to me HOW X WORKS --- but this wasn't obvious to me X YEARS AGO. Topics like this are a sweet spot. You'll be teaching people and you don't even realize it.

Second, 

- Obviousness is relative and not absolute. What is obvious to you is not to others. Past self
- Insight often comes from a chain of obvious statements
- Even if what you say is obvious it is still valuable for you to write -- you get better at writing and perhaps your reader enjoys themself
