Like many others my weapon of choice for tackling the internet is Google Chrome. Here are X shortcuts that I use everyday. It's too dramatic to say that I couldn't live without them, but, it is accurate to say that they make my life way better.

You're going to notice lots of these shortcuts are saving relatively easy mouse movements. For example pressing `CTRL` + `T` instead of moving your mouse to the plus sign for new tabs and clicking it. At first glance this optimization seems like overkill. However, when you consider that most knowledge workers spend hours of their day in a browser the math starts to add up for the time saved.

Conservatively we might estimate the time savings of the shortcut at 1 second.
1 second saved in aggregate.

# Opening and Closing Tabs

Press `CTRL` + `t` to open a new tab. Press `CTRL` + `w` to close the current tab.

Of all the shortcuts I easily use these the most. Like everyone else I always have a million tabs open. This saves me from constantly moving my mouse up to the top of the browser to open or close tabs.

# New window / New incognito

Sometimes you need to open a new window instead of just a tab. For example, I'll often put some reference documentation up in a different window that I can drag on to my second monitor. Also, as a developer easily being able to pull up an incognito window is great for testing web development things.

# Reopen tabs or window

This is my favorite shortcut. It was a total game changer when I learned about it. With this shortcut you no longer need to worry about going to your history after closing a tab. Or trying to painstakingly reopen all your tabs when you accidentally close your chrome window.

# Navigate through tabs

I'll often use this when I have a number of tabs that I need to flip through to compare and I don't have enough screen real estate to put them all side-by-side.

# Navigate backwards and forwards

Again, just another shortcut to save me from having to move my mouse up to the backwards and forwards arrows. Sounds like a really small thing but modern day knowledge workers spend a lot of time in the browser. The time you spend trying to aim your mouse at that tiny little button really adds over time.

# Search on pag

Pretty hard to imagine that you don't know this one. But using this can really save you a lot of time. Anytime your scrolling for something you know is on the page try searching for it and then using tab to rapidly go through the results.

# Select search bar

Another one I use all the time. With google built into the search bar this shortcut is basically my "google it" shortcut.

# Dev tools stuff

These ones are handy if you do lots of web development. Stop bothering to right click to get into the developer tools.

# Ctrl clicking links

I love opening links in new tabs. Combined with the shortcuts to navigate between tabs this is really powerful.

# Hard refresh

Pro tip as a web developer if you need to clear your caches

# Bonus: Tab to search results

This has exponentially sped up my googling. I can keep my hands on the keyboard an entired google search.....
