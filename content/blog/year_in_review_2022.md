**Fix date**

It's hard to believe that 2022 is nearly over. In keeping with [the](/blog/2020/year-in-review-2020) [tradition](/blog/2021/year-in-review-2021) here is my year end review. The review is composed of three parts: my top 10's for the year; a reflection on 2022 similar to my [halfway check-in](/blog/2022/2022-halfway-check-in); and my goals and aspirations for the new year.

I always find a review like this to be a joyous and worthwhile exercise. It's easy to forget about all the things you got to do throughout a whole year. If you like what you read here I would highly encourage you to do something similar.

## Top 10 Experiences

1. **Graduating** --- On December 19 I wrote the last ever final of my Computer Engineering degree. Getting this degree was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. After five and half years, more than a hundred midterms and finals, and thousands of hours of studying and doing homework, I'm ready to finally graduate. Overall I'm incredibly proud of this achievement and very glad that I decided to stick it out and not go to industry early.
2. **My sister's wedding** --- This was a very special experience because I'm very close with my sister. She was kind enough to ask me to be her man of honor which was such a privilege. It was also very exciting to welcome a new in-law to the family. And as an added bonus it was also just a very fun party.
3. **Learning to play hockey** --- Last year I [learned to skate](/blog/skating_my_way_to_a_new_mindset) and started playing shinny. I've continued this progression in a big way. Not only have I been skating a lot but I also joined a learn to play hockey league for adults. It was so much fun that I was literally vibrating with excitement before each practice.
4. **Summer in Seattle** --- This summer I was down in Seattle for an internship at Microsoft on the Azure Kubernetes Service team. It was an incredible three months and there is way too much to unpack here so the best I can do is share some highlights: making a lot of new friends; playing DnD for the first time; my weekend trip to Portland; winning the Microsoft Strike capture the flag; and my parents coming to visit.
5. **Trip to California** --- I spent a week in California at [a hackathon](blog/inception_studio_weekend_reflections) and catching up with friends. This was the most impromptu trip I've ever taken and thus was memorable for the spontaneity alone.
6. **Trip to the British Isles** --- I spent two weeks driving across Ireland and Scotland with my brother and sister-in-law. The highlight was all the epic landscapes I got to see.
7. **Vacationing in Invermere** --- The family and I spent a week at a beautiful VRBO in Invermere. We did a lot of fun things, but my absolute favorite part was all the laughter.
8. **Winning HackED 2022** --- In January I won the HackED 2022 hackathon with some friends. I wrote all about it [here](/blog/building_studybuddy_at_hacked_2022).
9. **Trip to Grand Prairie** --- A lot of my family lives up north in Grand Prairie. I got to spend a few days up there with my dad and grandmother which was a very special experience. In particular I enjoyed building new relationships with some of my aunts and uncles.
10. **Rex Orange County Concert** --- I ended up at this concert because of pure happenstance and made some really good friends. It poured rain the whole concert which oddly really amplified the experience and made it feel like it was just you and Rex.

Honorable mentions to the **Eagles concert**, **Sausage Day**, and **biking a metric century**.

## Top 10 Movies and TV Shows

1. **Succession** --- Totally lives up to all the hype. It has some of the best season ending twists I've ever seen.
2. **Top Gun 2** --- It's really cliché to like this movie but I unashamedly do. It is the perfect action movie.
3. **Breaking Bad** --- I know I'm really late to the party here but it totally holds up.
4. **Greyhound** --- I'm an absolute sucker for a realistic WW2 movie and this fits the bill. No surprise that Tom Hanks is involved.
5. **Ted Lasso** --- Ted Lasso was a nice injection of wholesome in my year. Although, I have to say I thought season 2 was terrible and a huge disappointment.
6. **Randy Feltface** --- I don't really know what to say about Randy Feltface other than that you need to go watch [all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4pkE3OFpkc&ab_channel=RandyFeltface) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ktb6Ksx1luY&ab_channel=Frenchipotle) [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzxAv9qz79s&ab_channel=RandyFeltface) [specials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXEcxvrrUYg&ab_channel=HeliumComedyStudios) right now.
7. **Barry Season 3** --- Barry still keeps delivering an absurd mix of comedy and drama.
8. **Hitch** --- A gold standard romantic comedy.
9. **Vengeance** --- I'm a big fan of B.J. Novak's work so I knew I had to watch this. I thought it was great although I can't say I loved the ending.
10. **Inventing Anna** --- I kinda hated that I liked this but it was a really addicting watch. Still can't get Anna's voice out of my head.

## Top 10 Books

1. **Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson** --- I couldn't put this book down. Kurson's portrayal of deep sea wreck diving had me on the edge of my seat. Best of all, it's a true story. Can't recommend you read this enough.
2. **Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir** --- I'm loathe to actually say anything about this book because I think it is a much better read if you go into it cold and without an idea of what is to come. That being said, Andy Weir lives up to his reputation of delivering a fantastic character driven read that's full of fun science.
3. **The Martian by Andy Weir** --- Even though this book is 11 years old and I'd already seen the movie I'm very glad I took the time to read it. I think the book is much better than the movie because you get to fully immerse yourself in the scientific writing that Weir is so good at.
4. **Leviathan Wakes by James S. A. Corey** --- The Expanse series paints the picture of a sci-fi world that I always dreamed about as a kid.
5. **Oscar And The Lady In Pink by Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt** --- A very short read. I cried at the end of the book.
6. **The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness by Eric Jorgenson** --- This book has so much condensed wisdom that I only glean a small portion of it on each read through. My favorite part were his life formulas e.g. Happiness = Health + Wealth + Good Relationships.
7. **Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green** --- I was a long time listener to the Anthropocene Reviewed podcast so it was fun to consume it in written form.
8. **What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe** --- What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions
9. **Numbers Don't Lie: 71 Things You Need to Know About the World by Vaclav Smil** --- This was a recommendation from my brother. I found it valuable to read something so quantitative in a world where we consume so much qualitative content.
10. **Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl** --- Definitely a tough read but worth it to be exposed to the dynamic range of humanity.

## Top 10 Others

This is to capture the music, podcasts, Youtubers, video games, and board games that I really enjoyed this year.

1. **Magic: The Gathering** --- Magic is a [collectible card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game) that I was first introduced to in junior high by my friend. I have really fond memories of hours spent in his basement learning to play. For a number of reasons we eventually stopped playing. However, this summer when I was in Seattle (the birthplace and mecca of Magic) I had a hankering to start playing again. There are multiple formats of Magic that you can play but by far my favorite is limited. In limited you sit around a table with 8 others passing packs of cards around as you draft a deck that you'll then play against your opponents. Since this summer I have made a very serious return to Magic and I'm absolutely loving it. I firmly believe that limited Magic is one of the funnest and most mentally stimulating ways to spend a few hours.
2. **Harry's House by Harry Styles** --- I basically just listened to this album on repeat all year. According to Spotify I was in the top 0.5% of listeners. My favorite songs were Daylight and Love Of My Life. I'll forever associate his second album with my trip to New Zealand and this album will forever be associated with my British Isles trip.
3. **All-In podcast** --- The All-In podcast continues to deliver. Although the show can sometimes get a little more political than I prefer, I am still addicted to feeling like I have secret access to billionaires conversations.
4. **Limited Resources podcast** --- This podcast is all about how to get better at playing Magic. I crushed so many of these episodes on my commute to work in the summer. Oddly enough I feel like I learned a lot of general life lessons from this podcast too.
5. **Acquired podcast** --- Never did I think I would be listening to 9 hour episodes about people like Warren Buffet but Acquired is so worth listening to. They also put on a killer in person show in Seattle that I was lucky enough to attend.
6. **Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers by Kendrick Lamar** --- I have a fairly limited exposure to rap, but I really like Kendrick Lamar. His latest album did not disappoint.
7. **Lords of Limited podcast** -- This podcast is also all about how to get better at playing Magic. Are you noticing a theme of how into Magic I am?
8. **Who Cares? by Rex Orange County** --- I really enjoyed this album. I first listened to it when driving up to Grand Prairie and I find I always love albums that are associated in my mind with travel. It also was really special to be able to watch Rex perform it live.
9. **Adam Ragusea** --- There is a lot of different Youtube creators that I watch but Adam Ragusea definitely rises to the top. I'm particularly fond of how he approaches learning.
10. **It Takes Two** --- This is a co-op video game that I played through with my friend. I'm not going to spoil anything but the settings kept getting crazier than I expected them to.

## Reflecting on 2022

### Career

> By the end of this year I'll graduate. With that in mind I'll need to start making some decisions about where I want to work full-time and where I want to live. I also want to consider less traditional options like digital nomading or consulting for the start of 2023.

TODO

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Graduate!
- [ ] Leverage my connections to have multiple full-time offers post-graduation.
- [ ] Seriously research the possibility of digital nomading or consulting at the start of 2023.

### Travel and Adventure

> Thanks to remote schooling and work I spend a lot of time at home. Traveling abroad and doing adventurous things is a great way to spice up my life.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Travel to Eastern Canada.
- [ ] Do a multi-night canoe trip on the North Saskatchewan.
- [ ] Bike an imperial century.

### Health

> I've had some trouble with physical and mental health problems over 2021. Looking forward to 2022 I want to take a more holistic approach to my health, or in other words, I want to do a lot of yoga.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Build a habit of doing yoga multiple times a week.
- [ ] Do a mix of body weight exercises at home and weightlifting at the gym.
- [ ] Keep biking and training for a century.

### Digital Life

> I find the digital world to be both a blessing and a curse, software itself is amoral but amplifies the underlying good or bad. On one hand I've never been more connected, empowered, and informed. On the other hand I've never felt so isolated, paralyzed, and confused. Not quite sure how to get off the treadmill or if I even want to, but the following seem like some rational first steps.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Avoid having my phone be the first thing I interact with in the morning.
- [ ] Limit the empty calories I consume i.e. Instagram, Youtube, etc.

### Finances

> 2021 was a big year for my finances: I read some great investing books; started investing in crypto; got my traditional investments in order; and built a big spreadsheet to help me keep track of my overall financial direction. I'd be happy if all I did in 2022 was continue to dollar cost average into my investments and keep my spreadsheet up to date — compounding will take care of the rest.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Keep dollar cost averaging into passive index funds, ETH, BTC.
- [ ] Keep my spreadsheet up to date.

### Building

> Building things makes me happy. I don't intend to be prescriptive about what I'll build in 2022 — all that matters is that I build something.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Build and publish 2+ projects.

### Reading

> Last year I focused on reading less short/medium-form blog content and more long-form book content. Blogs have their place, but I felt that I was missing some of the nuance you find in books. I also wanted to rediscover fiction. It was a good start last year but I want to pick up the pace. The Kobo I got for christmas should hopefully assist with this.

About 13 books

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Read 1.5+ books a month (for a total of 18+ over the year).

### Writing

> I tend to overthink (understatement of the year) so I should definitely be writing more. In the first year of this blog I managed to write eight posts. I chalk it up to a productive spurt in the early COVID lockdowns. In 2021 I only managed to write five. I think it'd be a big win if I wrote ten or more posts in 2022. Writing has compounding benefits so I want to start the compounding sooner than later.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Publish 10+ blog posts.

### Guitar

> Learning guitar was one of the best decisions I made in 2021 so I want to keep my foot on the gas pedal. The hardest thing here will be continuing to do focused practice; at the one year mark I have enough skill that I find it really easy to waste a whole practice session just noodling rather than working on the fundamentals.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Complete Justin Guitar Beginner Grade 3.
- [ ] Complete Justin Guitar Ear Training and Theory up to Grade 3.
- [ ] Keep playing in front of family and friends to practice performing.
- [ ] Find more people to jam with.
- [ ] Stretch goal: Record a cover of a song.

### Web 3.0

> 2021 was the year that I got red-pilled by crypto; I started buying ETH and BTC; I started mining HNT; but most of all I read and listened to a lot of crypto content. In 2022 I want to double down on actually tinkering around with crypto. I'm convinced that Web 3.0 is going to be huge so I want to get in early. The end goal of the tinkering is to discover what still needs to be built and to go build it.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Continue to dollar cost average my way into ETH and BTC.
- [ ] Purchase or host more Helium miners.
- [ ] Register an ENS domain.
- [ ] Try out some DeFi protocols.
- [ ] Buy some NFTs and get involved with the communities.
