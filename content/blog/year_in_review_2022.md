## Top 10 Books

1. **Shadow Divers by Robert Kurson** --- I couldn't put this book down. Kurson's portrayal of deep sea wreck diving had me on the edge of my seat. Best of all, it's a true story. Can't recommend you read this enough.
2. **Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir** --- I'm loathe to actually say anything about this book because I think it is a much better read if you go into it cold and without an idea of what is to come. That being said, Andy Weir lives up to his reputation of delivering a fantastic character driven read that's full of fun science.

## Top 10 Others

This is to capture the music, podcasts, Youtubers, video games, and board games that I really enjoyed this year.

1. **Magic: The Gathering** --- Magic is a [collectible card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game) that I was first introduced to in junior high by my friend Ryan. I have really fond memories of hours spent in his basement learning to play. For a number of reasons we eventually stopped playing. However, this summer when I was in Seattle (the birthplace and mecca of Magic) I had a hankering to start playing again. There are multiple formats of Magic that you can play but by far my favorite is limited. In limited you sit around a table with 8 others passing packs of cards around as you draft a deck that you'll then play against your opponents. Since this summer I have made a very serious return to Magic and I'm absolutely loving it. I firmly believe that limited Magic is one of the funnest and most mentally stimulating ways to spend a few hours.
2. **Harry's House by Harry Styles** --- I basically just listened to this album on repeat all year. According to Spotify I was in the top 0.5% of listeners. My favorite songs were Daylight and Love Of My Life. I'll forever associate his second album with my trip to New Zealand and this album will forever be associated with my British Isles trip.
3. **All-In podcast** --- The All-In podcast continues to deliver. Although the show can sometimes get a little more political than I prefer, I am still addicted to feeling like I have secret access to billionaires conversations.
4. **Limited Resources podcast** --- This podcast is all about how to get better at playing Magic. I crushed so many of these episodes on my commute to work in the summer. Oddly enough I feel like I learned a lot of general life lessons from this podcast too.
5. **Acquired podcast** --- Never did I think I would be listening to 9 hour episodes about people like Warren Buffet but Acquired is so worth listening to. They also put on a killer in person show in Seattle that I was lucky enough to attend.
6. **Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers by Kendrick Lamar** --- I have a fairly limited exposure to rap, but I really like Kendrick Lamar. His latest album did not disappoint.
7. **Lords of Limited podcast** -- This podcast is also all about how to get better at playing Magic. Are you noticing a theme of how into Magic I am?
8. **Who Cares? by Rex Orange County** --- I really enjoyed this album. I first listened to it when driving up to Grand Prairie and I find I always love albums that are associated in my mind with travel. It also was really special to be able to watch Rex perform it live.
9. **Adam Ragusea** --- There is a lot of different Youtube creators that I watch but Adam Ragusea definitely rises to the top. I'm particularly fond of how he approaches learning.
10. **It Takes Two** --- This is a co-op video game that I played through with my friend Joel. I'm not going to spoil anything but the settings kept getting crazier than I expected them to.

## Reflecting on 2022

### Career

> By the end of this year I'll graduate. With that in mind I'll need to start making some decisions about where I want to work full-time and where I want to live. I also want to consider less traditional options like digital nomading or consulting for the start of 2023.

TODO

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Graduate!
- [ ] Leverage my connections to have multiple full-time offers post-graduation.
- [ ] Seriously research the possibility of digital nomading or consulting at the start of 2023.

### Travel and Adventure

> Thanks to remote schooling and work I spend a lot of time at home. Traveling abroad and doing adventurous things is a great way to spice up my life.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Travel to Eastern Canada.
- [ ] Do a multi-night canoe trip on the North Saskatchewan.
- [ ] Bike an imperial century.

### Health

> I've had some trouble with physical and mental health problems over 2021. Looking forward to 2022 I want to take a more holistic approach to my health, or in other words, I want to do a lot of yoga.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Build a habit of doing yoga multiple times a week.
- [ ] Do a mix of body weight exercises at home and weightlifting at the gym.
- [ ] Keep biking and training for a century.

### Digital Life

> I find the digital world to be both a blessing and a curse, software itself is amoral but amplifies the underlying good or bad. On one hand I've never been more connected, empowered, and informed. On the other hand I've never felt so isolated, paralyzed, and confused. Not quite sure how to get off the treadmill or if I even want to, but the following seem like some rational first steps.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Avoid having my phone be the first thing I interact with in the morning.
- [ ] Limit the empty calories I consume i.e. Instagram, Youtube, etc.

### Finances

> 2021 was a big year for my finances: I read some great investing books; started investing in crypto; got my traditional investments in order; and built a big spreadsheet to help me keep track of my overall financial direction. I'd be happy if all I did in 2022 was continue to dollar cost average into my investments and keep my spreadsheet up to date — compounding will take care of the rest.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Keep dollar cost averaging into passive index funds, ETH, BTC.
- [ ] Keep my spreadsheet up to date.

### Building

> Building things makes me happy. I don't intend to be prescriptive about what I'll build in 2022 — all that matters is that I build something.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Build and publish 2+ projects.

### Reading

> Last year I focused on reading less short/medium-form blog content and more long-form book content. Blogs have their place, but I felt that I was missing some of the nuance you find in books. I also wanted to rediscover fiction. It was a good start last year but I want to pick up the pace. The Kobo I got for christmas should hopefully assist with this.

About 13 books

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Read 1.5+ books a month (for a total of 18+ over the year).

### Writing

> I tend to overthink (understatement of the year) so I should definitely be writing more. In the first year of this blog I managed to write eight posts. I chalk it up to a productive spurt in the early COVID lockdowns. In 2021 I only managed to write five. I think it'd be a big win if I wrote ten or more posts in 2022. Writing has compounding benefits so I want to start the compounding sooner than later.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Publish 10+ blog posts.

### Guitar

> Learning guitar was one of the best decisions I made in 2021 so I want to keep my foot on the gas pedal. The hardest thing here will be continuing to do focused practice; at the one year mark I have enough skill that I find it really easy to waste a whole practice session just noodling rather than working on the fundamentals.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Complete Justin Guitar Beginner Grade 3.
- [ ] Complete Justin Guitar Ear Training and Theory up to Grade 3.
- [ ] Keep playing in front of family and friends to practice performing.
- [ ] Find more people to jam with.
- [ ] Stretch goal: Record a cover of a song.

### Web 3.0

> 2021 was the year that I got red-pilled by crypto; I started buying ETH and BTC; I started mining HNT; but most of all I read and listened to a lot of crypto content. In 2022 I want to double down on actually tinkering around with crypto. I'm convinced that Web 3.0 is going to be huge so I want to get in early. The end goal of the tinkering is to discover what still needs to be built and to go build it.

{{< begin_task_list >}}

- [ ] Continue to dollar cost average my way into ETH and BTC.
- [ ] Purchase or host more Helium miners.
- [ ] Register an ENS domain.
- [ ] Try out some DeFi protocols.
- [ ] Buy some NFTs and get involved with the communities.
