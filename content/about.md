  Since February 2020 I've been working at
  [UnifyID](https://unify.id) as a Software Engineer Intern. Currently, I'm
  working part-time with them. We're working to make passive authentication a
  reality using applied machine learning. Usually, I can be found working with the
  backend team using **Golang**, **Python**, and **React.js** to build reliable
  and scalable platforms for our products. Lately, I've been flexing my
  **Android** skills by helping the SDK team build some apps.

  I'm in my 4th year of studying Computer Engineering at the
  [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca)
  and will be graduating in 2022. Some of my favorite classes so far have been
  Operating Systems and Databases. Right now I'm in a Machine Learning class
  and it's a hoot. In my 2nd year I was a member of [ARVP](https://www.arvp.org),
  a robotics club on campus.

  In the Summer of 2019 I was an Explore Intern at Microsoft in Redmond,
  Washington. I worked on the [Azure.com](https://azure.microsoft.com)
  team. My main project was building an extension for the teams
  **CI/CD** in **JavaScript** that helped improve code performance
  without sacrificing developer velocity. I also helped research, prototype,
  and validate performance improvements like caching and code splitting. My
  return offer has been deferred to the Summer of 2021 due to COVID-19.

  When I'm not busy with school or an internship there are a few other things
  I like to do. **Travel** is my favorite activity - it always opens my
  eyes. I've been lucky enough to backpack across Western Europe and caravan
  around New Zealand. **Scuba diving** is great too, even in cold Canadian
  lakes. My guilty pleasure is binging on developer blogs, email newsletters,
  and tech podcasts. Lately, I've been getting into weightlifting.
