  Over the past year I worked at [UnifyID](https://unify.id) as a Software Engineer
  Intern in both full and part time capacities. They are working to make passive authentication a reality using applied machine learning. I could usually be found working with the backend team using **Golang**, **Python**, and **React.js** to build reliable
  and scalable platforms for their products. I also got the chance to flex my
  **Android** skills by helping the SDK team build an app. I wrote a
  [blog post](https://blog.unify.id/2021/04/15/my-never-ending-internship/)
  about my time there.

  I'm in my 4th year of studying Computer Engineering at the
  [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca)
  and will be graduating in 2022. Some of my favorite classes so far have been
  **Operating Systems** and **Databases**. I've also taken classes on **Algorithms**
  and **Machine Learning**. In my 2nd year I was a member of [ARVP](https://www.arvp.org),
  a robotics club on campus. On the weekends I volunteer with [Schulich Ignite](https://schulichignite.com/) to help teach highschool students how to program.

  In the Summer of 2019 I was an Explore Intern at Microsoft in Redmond,
  Washington. I worked on the [Azure.com](https://azure.microsoft.com)
  team. My main project was building an extension for the teams
  **CI/CD** in **JavaScript** that helped improve code performance
  without sacrificing developer velocity. I also helped research, prototype,
  and validate performance improvements like caching and code splitting. My
  return offer has been deferred to the Summer of 2021 due to COVID-19.

  When I'm not busy with school or an internship there are a few other things
  I like to do. **Traveling** is my favorite. I've been lucky enough to backpack across Western Europe and caravan
  around New Zealand. **Scuba diving** is great too, even in cold Canadian
  lakes. My guilty pleasure is binging on developer blogs, email newsletters,
  and tech podcasts. Lately, I've been getting into weightlifting and guitar. I'm looking forward to buying
  my first electric guitar.
