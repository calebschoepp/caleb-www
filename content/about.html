    I'm in my 3rd year of studying Computer Engineering at the
    <a class="underline" href="https://www.ualberta.ca"
      >University of Alberta</a
    >
    and will be graduating in 2022. Some of my favorite classes so far have been
    Assembly and Database Systems. I'm looking forward to Compilers and
    Operating Systems. During my 2nd year I was a member of
    <a class="underline" href="https://www.arvp.org">ARVP</a>, a robotics club
    on campus.

    In the summer of 2019 I was an Explore Intern at Microsoft in Redmond,
    Washington. I worked on the
    <a class="underline" href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Azure.com</a> team.
    My main project was building an extension for the teams <b>CI/CD</b> in
    <b>JavaScript</b> that helped improve code performance without sacraficing
    developer velocity. I also helped research, prototype, and validate
    performance improvements like caching and code splitting.

    When I'm not busy with school or an internship there are a few other things
    I like to do. <b>Travel</b> is my favorite - it always open my eyes. I've
    been lucky enough to backpack across Western Europe and caravan around New
    Zealand. <b>Scuba diving</b> is great too, even in cold Canadian lakes. I
    also keep up with the tech world by reading my favorite blogs and
    newsletters. Lately, I've been getting into flying FPV <b>drones</b>.
