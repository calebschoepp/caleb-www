    as a Software Engineer Intern. Currently, I'm working part-time with them.
    We're working to make passive authentication a reality using applied machine
    learning. Usually, I can be found working with the backend team using
    <b>Golang</b>, <b>Python</b>, and <b>React.js</b> to build reliable and
    scalable platforms for our products. Lately, I've been flexing my
    <b>Android</b>
    skills by helping the SDK team build some apps.

    without sacrificing developer velocity. I also helped research, prototype,

    return offer has been deferred to the Summer of 2021 due to COVID-19.

    When I'm not busy with school or an internship there are a few other things
    I like to do. <b>Travel</b> is my favorite activity - it always opens my
    eyes. I've been lucky enough to backpack across Western Europe and caravan
    around New Zealand. <b>Scuba diving</b> is great too, even in cold Canadian
    lakes. My guilty pleasure is binging on developer blogs, email newsletters,
    and tech podcasts. Lately, I've been getting into weightlifting.
