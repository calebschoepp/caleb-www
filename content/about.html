    I'm in my 3rd year of studying Computer Engineering at the University of
    Alberta and will be graduating in 2022. Some of my favorite classes so far
    have been Assembly and Database Systems. I'm looking forward to Compilers
    and Operating Systems. During my 2nd year I was a member of ARVP, a robotics
    club on campus.
