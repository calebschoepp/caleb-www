    lot of work. I looked to solve this problem by builidng a website that
    congregates the photoshops for an easier viewing experience. You can check

    <b>Node.js</b>. It is hosted on <b>Heroku</b> and uses a
    <b>PostgreSQL</b> database.

    hackathon I worked with a team to build a project called
    <b>Trail Smarts</b>. Our project used machine learning to build unique
    hiking profiles based on users GPS data from hikes. With these profiles, a
    <b>React.js</b> frontend - which I helped build - could visualize how easy a
    particular hike would be for you and how well you would pair with other
    hikers on that hike.

    For the final project of CMPUT 275 I worked with a partner to build a Sodoku
    solver visualizer. Numerous different solving algorithms were written in
    <b>C++</b>. For the visualizing component a UI was written to run on an
    <b>Arduino</b> and an over the wire format was used to send visualization
    data between the UI and solving backend.
