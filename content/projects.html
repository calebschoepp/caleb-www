    I'm in my 3rd year of studying Computer Engineering at the University of
    Alberta and will be graduating in 2022. Some of my favorite classes so far
    have been Assembly and Database Systems. During my 2nd year I was a member
    of ARVP, a robotics club on campus. I pride myself in academics and have
    maintained a 3.7 GPA.
