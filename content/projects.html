    to work on and I loved the tech stack I chose; a <b>Go</b> and <b>PostgreSQL</b> backend serving static
    <b>HTML</b>, styled via <b>Tailwind.css</b>, with a touch of
    vanilla <b>JS</b> here and there for some interactivity. Throw it up on <b>Heroku</b>
    and you've got a fully functioning website in a jiffy. I also had some fun designing it
    in <b>Figma</b>.

    that takes you from zero to programming language hero. In the book you implement
    an interpreted language called Lox. After finishing the book I continued to improve
    my implementation that I was calling

    lot of work. I looked to solve this problem by builidng a website that
    congregates the photoshops for an easier viewing experience. You can check
