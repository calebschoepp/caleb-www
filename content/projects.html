    I'm an avid reader of weekly email newsletters that congregate links the top
    links of a week. However, I can't read my newsletters on the train where
    there is no internet. I'm building a project called
    <a
      class="underline text-red-600 hover:text-red-800"
      href="https://linkedoffline.com"
      >LinkedOffline</a
    >
    that will turn an email newsletter into a pdf that has all the content
    pre-loaded in it and linked together. Now it can be viewed offline anytime!
    It has a serverless backend in <b>Python</b> and <b>Node.js</b>

    hackathon I worked with a team to build a project called
    <b>Trail Smarts</b>. Our project used machine learning to build unique
    hiking profiles based on users GPS data from hikes. With these profiles, a
    <b>React.js</b> frontend - which I helped build - could visualize how easy a
    particular hike would be for you and how well you would pair with other
    hikers on that hike.

    For the final project of CMPUT 275 I worked with a partner to build a Sodoku
    solver visualizer. Numerous different solving algorithms were written in
    <b>C++</b>. For the visualizing component a UI was written to run on an
    <b>Arduino</b> and an over the wire format was used to send visualization
    data between the UI and solving backend.
